# Power-BI-Accessibility-Checker

![Accessibility Checker](./documentation/images/Instructions%20Page.jpg)

Use the Power BI Accessibility Checker to understand whether your Power BI report meets minimum accessibility standards, and find where and how you can make improvements to the accessibility of your report. This checker looks at three top areas for accessibility: Tab Order, Alt Text, and Color Contrast. It also checks the color contrast of your report's selected theme.

*Disclaimer*: This is version 1. Please let me know if you encounter any errors with it.

There are two versions of the Power BI Accessibility Checker:

1. Power BI Accessibility Checker.pbix - This will check areas for accessibility of .pbix files on your desktop.
2. Power BI Accessibility Checker - Service.pbit - This will check areas for accessibility of Power BI reports in a workspace.

# Instructions

## Power BI Accessibility Checker.pbix Installation
Download the Power BI Field Finder.pbit template file.  

1.  Open the Accessibility Checker.pbix file. You'll see the accessibility checks of the sample WoW 2023 Week 8 sample file. To have it run checks against your files, change the report parameters to point to a location on your computer (and optionally a specific file, or whether to include subfolders). For example, if your pbix file is saved in C:\Test Files and is named "My Report", then the value for this parameter should be "C:\Files" and optionally you can include the name of your report.

2.  Click the Load button, and easily see your tab order and alt text on the following pages. Color contrast is a bit trickier, so for this version you can enter a hex code for a color that you'd like to compare against the colors on your visuals. This color is also compared against the colors of the selected theme.

3.  When you make changes to your pbix file, save it and refresh the Power BI Accessibility Checker.  If you'd like to analyze a different report, update the parameter to the file path and filename of another pbix file.
